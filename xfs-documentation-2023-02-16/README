XFS Documentation README
________________________

This source tree contains the raw documentation for the XFS project.
For more information and details on how to contribute to the
XFS project see the web pages at:
	http://xfs.org/

The documentation within this repository is written in ASCIIDOC, and
is designed to be as format neutral as possible. Information on
ASCIIDOC can be found here:
	http://asciidoc.org/

The intent is to be able to build the documentation into the format
you require for publication simply by building a different target.
See the file INSTALL for build, installation and post-install
configuration steps.
